That’s a solid start! Let’s break down how to segment the CASA (Current Account Savings Account) portfolio using client, account, and transaction-level historical data. I’ll guide you through a data-driven approach, helping you define clear rules for each segment so the bank can take targeted actions.

Step 1: Define clear segmentation criteria

Let’s refine your segments and outline the data points you need:

1. CASA Gamer / Price Sensitive

Behavior: Actively moves funds in and out, seeks best interest rates, fee-conscious.

Indicators:

High frequency of large withdrawals and deposits.

Reacts to changes in interest rates or fees.

Low average balance with high fluctuation (balance volatility).


Objective:

Balance retention: Offer rate-linked incentives.

Deepening relationships: Cross-sell fee-based products or investment plans.




2. Transactional (Main Bank Relationship)

Behavior: Uses CASA for daily banking — salary credits, bill payments, regular transactions.

Indicators:

High count of incoming salary credits.

Multiple utility, loan, or credit card payments.

Steady average balance with moderate fluctuation.


Objective:

Becoming the main bank: Incentivize bundling of services (cards, loans).

Deepening relationships: Promote wealth management or insurance.




3. Sleepy Balance (Dormant / Low Activity)

Behavior: Low or no transaction activity but maintains a balance.

Indicators:

Few or no debit/credit transactions in the last 6 months.

Consistently low activity with a stagnant balance.


Objective:

Balance retention: Prevent balance erosion through reactivation campaigns or fee waivers.




4. CASA Gamer – Receptive to Wealth

Behavior: Actively transacts and maintains a high balance — potential to invest.

Indicators:

Consistent high balance (percentile-based threshold, e.g., top 10%).

Evidence of transactions involving investments, insurance, or wealth products.


Objective:

Wealth penetration: Offer tailored investment opportunities, priority banking, or RM-led services.

Step 2: Build data pipelines to identify segments

Leverage the following key data points from your historical data:

1. Client-level data:

Age, income, occupation.

Relationship vintage (time since opening the CASA account).



2. Account-level data:

Average monthly balance (AMB).

Number of debit and credit transactions per month.

Balance volatility (standard deviation of balances over time).



3. Transaction-level data:

Count and amount of salary credits.

Frequency and types of bill payments.

Investment-related transaction tags (like mutual funds, SIPs, insurance premiums).

Step 3: Apply segmentation logic

You can use a rule-based or clustering approach:

1. Rule-based segmentation:
Define thresholds for each segment.

import pandas as pd

# Example dataset with dummy data
df = pd.read_csv('casa_data.csv')

# Define segments
df['segment'] = 'Unclassified'
df.loc[(df['balance_volatility'] > 10000) & (df['avg_balance'] < 50000), 'segment'] = 'CASA Gamer / Price Sensitive'
df.loc[(df['salary_credits'] >= 3) & (df['bill_payments'] >= 3), 'segment'] = 'Transactional'
df.loc[(df['transactions_last_6m'] == 0) & (df['avg_balance'] > 10000), 'segment'] = 'Sleepy Balance'
df.loc[(df['avg_balance'] > 200000) & (df['investment_txns'] > 0), 'segment'] = 'CASA Gamer - Receptive to Wealth'

print(df.groupby('segment').size())


2. Clustering-based segmentation:
Use K-means clustering or hierarchical clustering to identify patterns.

from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

features = df[['avg_balance', 'balance_volatility', 'salary_credits', 'bill_payments', 'investment_txns']]
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_features = scaler.fit_transform(features)

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4)
df['segment'] = kmeans.fit_predict(scaled_features)

Step 4: Validate and fine-tune segments

Stability: Check if clients remain in their segments over time or switch frequently.

Profitability: Analyze average balances, fees paid, and revenues generated by each segment.

Actionability: Ensure segments are large enough and have clear strategies for growth.



---

Step 5: Design targeted strategies

1. CASA Gamer / Price Sensitive:

Offer fee waivers for bundling multiple products.

Target them with personalized deposit rate offers.



2. Transactional:

Introduce auto-debit setups for EMIs or SIPs.

Cross-sell credit cards or personal loans.



3. Sleepy Balance:

Run reactivation campaigns (special rates for reactivation).

Assign RMs for high-value dormant accounts.



4. CASA Gamer - Receptive to Wealth:

Organize wealth webinars.

Promote mutual funds, bonds, and insurance tailored to their profile.
